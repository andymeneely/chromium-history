# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp
/test/tmp
/test/version_tmp
*.swp
*.swo
*.gem
*.rbc

# Ignoring platform-specific Gemfile.lock
# Yes, this is not supposed to be how it works. But https://github.com/bundler/bundler-features/issues/4 references a long history of complaints and they are fixing this to make Gemfile.lock be more cross-platform. If we don't ignore it, we'll be checking in this file over and over again if we want to work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
