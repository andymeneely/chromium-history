Mac has Cut, Copy, Paste, Font&gt;, Spelling and Grammar&gt;, Substitutions&gt;, Speech&gt;, Writing

appear at the top, so even if they do belong here on some level, on another level they probably 
shouldn't interfere with important items like the editing commands.

http://fbarchard-kir.ad.corp.google.com/mediatests/runthrough.mp4 file.
it works okay in safari and mplayer.
it decodes okay in media_bench as well.

the video is 1366 wide which is not a multiple of 16.
a 1280x720 version of the same video is okay.
it was encoded with adobe media encoder

the problem is likely a memory overflow."
