The AudioManager unit tests do not use\nthe actual audio thread, so this part seems to have been left out.\n\nIn Chrome, the AudioManager instance is now owned by BrowserProcessImpl\nand always constructed on the UI thread.  This instance is then shared\nin the same way that several other 'manager' type objects are shared to\n'content' code, via content::ResourceContext.  Audio specific classes\ndo though receive a direct pointer to the AudioManager and are required\nto do proper reference counting if they need to hold onto the instance.\nI chose to use the ResourceContext rather than direct use of g_browser_process\nto avoid requiring another singleton when writing relatively simple tests\nthat touch the AudioManager.\n\nI added a couple of safeguards to guard against future regressions:\n- Not more than one instance of the AudioManager should be created.\n- The AudioManager should not be addrefed by its own thread.  This\n  can basically become a circular reference and prevent deterministic\n  shutdown.\n\nReviewers:  Of course you're free to review everything,\nbut here's the breakdown in terms of the bare minimum from\nthe standpoint of \"Owners approval\".

What type of situation are you protecting us from here?\n\nThis is a safeguard to make sure that there exists never more than one instance of the AudioManager.  This variable is not exposed or used for anything other than to check if there already exists an instance and catch the programmer error early.\nThe checks are in the constructor and destructor.  The check in AudioManager::Create isn't really necessary, but I put it there in case anyone would ever return an \"AudioManager\" that does not derive from the AudioManager class.\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/8818012/diff/7002/content/browser/resource_context.cc\nFile content/browser/resource_context.cc (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/8818012/diff/7002/content/browser/resource_context.cc#newcode184\ncontent/browser/resource_context.cc:184: // The AudioManager isn't necessarily initialized with other\nOn 2011/12/06 17:02:12, willchan wrote:\n> Can you explain this comment?

I must have forgotten to update it since an early version of the cl.  I'll fix it.\n\nWhen Chrome runs, the audio manager instance is created and owned by the BrowserProcessImpl class.  This always happens on the IO thread and (as you no doubt know) there is a check inside EnsureInitialized() for that.\nWhat's different here though, and the reason why there isn't a dcheck here like with the other accessors, is that the audio_manager accessor can be called on other threads than the IO thread.  I suspect that the reason for this is historical since the AudioManager was a singleton with an undefined threading model and anyone could call the instance method at any time and on any thread.","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-12-06 20:28:48.067278","approval":false},{"sender":"phajdan.jr@chromium.org","recipients":["tommi@chromium.org","henrika@chromium.org","scherkus@chromium.org","satish@chromium.org","avi@chromium.org","willchan@chromium.org","xians@chromium.org","robert.nagy@gmail.com","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","jstritar+watch@chromium.org","hclam+watch@chromium.org","dpranke-watch+content@chromium.org","ddorwin+watch@chromium.org","fischman+watch@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","acolwell+watch@chromium.org","annacc+watch@chromium.org","mihaip+watch@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","phajdan.jr@chromium.org","vrk@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org","scherkus@chromium.org","ihf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"I took a brief look, seems fine.

However, I don't think that applying that timeout to an audio stream of a fixed length, and not an action, is the right use of that timer.  We should rather use a fixed timeout.\nSo, the question becomes, how long should the timeout be?\nI picked 2 seconds as random.

As the comment explains, Stop() will not return until all pending messages have been processed, including the one we just posted.\n\nRegarding an alternative method, I'm not sure if you mean 1) an alternative method of waiting for ShutdownOnAudioThread to complete or if 2) we can somehow differently uninitialize the dispatchers. So, I'll answer both.\n\n1) There are other ways such as by using a WaitableEvent, but this is a simpler way that doesn't require any additional synchronization objects to the thread itself. Also, it's really just two lines of code (well, two semicolons), so it's hard to beat with regards to simplicity. ;)\n\n2) The dispatchers are single threaded objects that perform most of their work on the audio thread (and correctly have a lot of DCHECKs to make sure it stays that way).  As such, they really must be torn down from that same thread to keep things robust.  Additionally, the map that holds onto the dispatchers does not have any lock to guard against multithreaded access, so it too must only be accessed from the audio thread, so the\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/8818012/diff/7002/media/audio/audio_output_controller.h\nFile media/audio/audio_output_controller.h (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/8818012/diff/7002/media/audio/audio_output_controller.h#newcode247\nmedia/audio/audio_output_controller.h:247: // Used to post delayed tasks to ourselves that we can cancel.\nOn 2011/12/07 10:08:34, henrika1 wrote:\n> Can you add some more details on why you had to introduce this pattern.

This is also true in the implementation as it was, but instead of deleting the object straight away, it delayed it by posting a task to the message queue.  Doing so is however not necessary and has two downsides: It leaves the door open to flakiness, it can delay shutdown since the message queue has to keep running in order to delete the task.","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-12-07 12:26:43.218372","approval":false},{"sender":"henrika@chromium.org","recipients":["tommi@chromium.org","henrika@chromium.org","scherkus@chromium.org","satish@chromium.org","avi@chromium.org","willchan@chromium.org","xians@chromium.org","robert.nagy@gmail.com","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","jstritar+watch@chromium.org","hclam+watch@chromium.org","dpranke-watch+content@chromium.org","ddorwin+watch@chromium.org","fischman+watch@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","acolwell+watch@chromium.org","annacc+watch@chromium.org","mihaip+watch@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","phajdan.jr@chromium.org","vrk@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org","scherkus@chromium.org","ihf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"http://codereview.chromium.org/8818012/diff/7002/content/browser/renderer_host/media/audio_input_renderer_host.cc\nFile content/browser/renderer_host/media/audio_input_renderer_host.cc (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/8818012/diff/7002/content/browser/renderer_host/media/audio_input_renderer_host.cc#newcode249\ncontent/browser/renderer_host/media/audio_input_renderer_host.cc:249: resource_context_->audio_manager(),\nSorry, I had this question in my head from another file.

While it's not strictly a problem, it's different from the existing threading model and we should be careful here. ResourceContext is created and owned by ProfileIOData, which will be deleted on the IO thread and thus ResourceContext will get deleted on the IO thread. We need to think carefully about the shutdown case here. Note the shutdown order indicated by http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/content/public/browser/browser_thread.h&exact_package=chromium&q=browser_thread.h&type=cs&l=56.

I'm going to go back and take a look at those places where audio_manager() is accessed from the FILE or UI thread.  If it's only from unit tests, then I think that might be easy to fix and this accessor can abide the same rules as all the others.

I wanted to go with a fixed value since this is an audio file and it's long enough for you to hear a word or two.  A second or even less would do fine too.

This variable is not exposed or used for anything other than to check if there already exists an instance and catch the programmer error early.\nThe checks are in the constructor and destructor.  The check in AudioManager::Create isn't really necessary, but I put it there in case anyone would ever return an \"AudioManager\" that does not derive from the AudioManager

I must have forgotten to update it since an early version of the cl.  I'll fix it.\n\nWhen Chrome runs, the audio manager instance is created and owned by the BrowserProcessImpl class.  This always happens on the IO thread and (as you no doubt know) there is a check inside EnsureInitialized() for that.\nWhat's different here though, and the reason why there isn't a dcheck here like with the other accessors, is that the audio_manager accessor can be called on other threads than the IO thread.

While it's not strictly a problem, it's different from the existing threading model and we should be careful here. ResourceContext is created and owned by ProfileIOData, which will be deleted on the IO thread and thus ResourceContext will get deleted on the IO thread. We need to think carefully about the shutdown case here. Note the shutdown order indicated by http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/content/public/browser/browser_thread.h&exact_package=chromium&q=browser_thread.h&type=cs&l=56. If ResourceContext is used on any thread which outlasts the IO thread, then we have a problem, because ResourceContext may be deleted, and we'll get a use after free.\n\nThis is the reason we have always just forced the accessors to be non-threadsafe and only accessible on the IO thread.","draft":false,"lineno":184,"date":"2011-12-07 15:29:20.381932","left":false}],"id":7024,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/audio_output_dispatcher.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":5,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":38,"num_removed":8,"messages":[{"author":"henrika","author_email":"henrika@chromium.org","text":"Not sure why this is needed.","draft":false,"lineno":22,"date":"2011-12-07 10:08:34.505579","left":false},{"author":"tommi","author_email":"tommi@chromium.org","text":"On 2011/12/07 10:08:34, henrika1 wrote:\n> Not sure why this is needed.\n\nIt allows |this| to be used in an initializer list without a warning when you know it is safe to do so.

So, I might as well preemptively answer :)\n\nPreviously, the timeout was by default 10 seconds.  This timeout is an 'action timeout' and it was me that originally put it there.  However, I don't think that applying that timeout to an audio stream of a fixed length, and not an action, is the right use of that timer.  We should rather use a fixed timeout.\nSo, the question becomes, how long should the timeout be?\nI picked 2 seconds as random.

As the comment explains, Stop() will not return until all pending messages have been processed, including the one we just posted.\n\nRegarding an alternative method, I'm not sure if you mean 1) an alternative method of waiting for ShutdownOnAudioThread to complete or if 2) we can somehow differently uninitialize the dispatchers. So, I'll answer both.\n\n1) There are other ways such as by using a WaitableEvent, but this is a simpler way that doesn't require any additional synchronization objects to the thread itself. Also, it's really just two lines of code (well, two semicolons), so it's hard to beat with regards to simplicity. ;)\n\n2) The dispatchers are single threaded objects that perform most of their work on the audio thread (and correctly have a lot of DCHECKs to make sure it stays that way).  As such, they really must be torn down from that same thread to keep things robust.  Additionally, the map that holds onto the dispatchers does not have any lock to guard against multithreaded access, so it too must only be accessed from the audio thread, so the ","draft":false,"lineno":100,"date":"2011-12-07 12:26:44.224938","left":false}],"id":7044,"is_binary":false},"content/browser/renderer_host/media/media_stream_dispatcher_host_unittest.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":3,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":5,"num_removed":1,"messages":[],"id":7019,"is_binary":false},"content/browser/renderer_host/render_process_host_impl.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":5,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":43,"num_removed":50,"messages":[],"id":7023,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/linux/audio_manager_linux.h":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":2,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":2,"num_removed":3,"messages":[],"id":7058,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/audio_output_proxy.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":2,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":9,"num_removed":4,"messages":[{"author":"henrika","author_email":"henrika@chromium.org","text":"Have to trust you on this part.

This is also true in the implementation as it was, but instead of deleting the object straight away, it delayed it by posting a task to the message queue.  Doing so is however not necessary and has two downsides: It leaves the door open to flakiness, it can delay shutdown since the message queue has to keep running in order to delete the task.","draft":false,"lineno":92,"date":"2011-12-07 12:26:44.225826","left":false}],"id":7051,"is_binary":false},"content/browser/renderer_host/media/media_stream_manager.h":{"status":"M

I wanted to go with a fixed value since this is an audio file and it's long enough for you to hear a word or two.  A second or even less would do fine too.  I initially used action_timeout_ms() here since tiny was too short and this was the next timeout value in the line.

Thanks.\n\nMost of the problems with non-root X come in the form of dealing with the input devices sanely. Everything else is ready (mostly due to KMS). Generally, rootless X should work fine, though it's still (obviously) a relatively new way to do things.\n\nAs for this patch, it seems fine, but the comment being removed seems odd to me, like we're overlooking something here.

It sounds like we could — in principle, and if it turns out to be necessary — make the segment 0660 and use shmctl(2) to set the GID to xorg's GID.\n\nWe would obviously need some portable way to discover the UID/GID that runs the X process.

Using DISPLAY=machinename:0, and NX from the host itself and from a remote host, results in XShmAttach success (according to the verbose logging I added).\n\nThe only time XShmAttach fails is when I ssh -X from my Mac to my Linux. That's expected, of course. And Chrome still works in this scenario, it's just slow. Much of the slowness is due to network latency, of course (I am WFH today).\n\nSo I haven't yet seen a scenario in which the reduced permissions causes an XShmAttach failure when it should have succeeded. If anyone can cook one up, I'll try to tweak this patch to first try with 0600 then fall back on 0666 so that in normal scenarios people don't expose their shared memory when they don't have to. If nobody can cook up a plausible failure scenario, then I think this CL should go through.","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-09-07 19:06:21.799100","approval":false},{"sender":"palmer@chromium.org","recipients":["palmer@chromium.org","agl@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","yusukes+watch@chromium.org","derat+watch@chromium.org","keescook@chromium.org","jln@chromium.org","cevans@chromium.org","jorgelo@chromium.org"],"text":"Adding cevans and jorgelo in case they have additional insight.","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-09-07 19:07:07.079480","approval":false},{"sender":"agl@chromium.org","recipients":["palmer@chromium.org","agl@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","yusukes+watch@chromium.org","derat+watch@chromium.org","keescook@chromium.org","jln@chromium.org","cevans@chromium.org","jorgelo@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-09-07 19:08:07.428850","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["palmer@chromium.org","agl@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","yusukes+watch@chromium.org","derat+watch@chromium.org","keescook@chromium.org","jln@chromium.org","cevans@chromium.org","jorgelo@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
