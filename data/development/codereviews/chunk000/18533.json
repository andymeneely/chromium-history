{"description":"Merge r5767 - Protect cookie headers from XHR\n\nAdd a flags to further control response header persistence.  We use this to\nfilter out Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 response headers from being forwarded to\nthe renderer.  This serves to prevent the renderer from having any access to\nHttpOnly cookies, and it also prevents XMLHttpRequest consumers from being able\nto read cookies in the HTTP response headers.  This is consistent with changes\nmade to Firefox and WebKit.\n\nPatch by marius.schilder@gmail.com\nR=deanm,darin\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/11264\nTBR=darin@chromium.org\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=8529","cc":["chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"reviewers":["darin@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"laforge@chromium.org","recipients":["laforge@chromium.org","darin@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-01-23 00:50:11.393823","approval":false},{"sender":"darin@chromium.org","recipients":["laforge@chromium.org","darin@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"LGTM","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-01-23 00:52:56.123750","approval":true}],"owner_email":"laforge@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://chrome-svn/chrome/branches/release_154.next/src/","owner":"laforge","subject":"Merge r5767 - Protect cookie headers from XHR...","created":"2009-01-23 00:50:06.818679","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-05-27 03:25:30.273553","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":18533}
