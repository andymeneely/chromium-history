I wanted to go with a fixed value since this is an audio file and it's long enough for you to hear a word or two.  A second or even less would do fine too.  I initially used action_timeout_ms() here since tiny was too short and this was the next timeout value in the line.  However, since what we're doing here isn't really an \"action\" I figured having a constant would make more sense.\nI can change it to e.g. action_timeout_ms() / 10 or 5 if you want.","draft":false,"lineno":352,"date":"2011-12-10 00:11:14.083152","left":false}],"id":19034,"is_binary":false},"chrome/test/base/testing_browser_process.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":1,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":4,"num_removed":0,"messages":[],"id":19011,"is_binary":false},"content/browser/renderer_host/media/audio_input_device_manager.h":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":3,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":4,"num_removed":1,"messages":[],"id":19014,"is_binary":false},"content/browser/speech/speech_input_manager.h":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":4,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":12,"num_removed":3,"messages":[],"id":19030,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/linux/alsa_input.h":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":3,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":4,"num_removed":1,"messages":[{"author":"scherkus","author_email":"scherkus@chromium.org","text":"document that this is not reffed?","draft":false,"lineno":59,"date":"2011-12-09 22:47:30.380750","left":false},{"author":"tommi","author_email":"tommi@chromium.org","text":"On 2011/12/09 22:47:30, scherkus wrote:\n> document that this is not reffed?\n\nDone.","draft":false,"lineno":59,"date":"2011-12-10 00:11:14.084539","left":false}],"id":19055,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/win/audio_output_win_unittest.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":17,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":26,"num_removed":37,"messages":[{"author":"scherkus","author_email":"scherkus@chromium.org","text":"ASSERT_TRUE(oas->Open())?\n\nwould do away w/ opened bool","draft":false,"lineno":561,"date":"2011-12-09 22:47:30.382565","left":false},{"author":"tommi","author_email":"tommi@chromium.org","text":"On 2011/12/09 22:47:30, scherkus wrote:\n> ASSERT_TRUE(oas->Open())?\n> \n> would do away w/ opened bool\n\nWe still need to call Close(), but I've fixed this already on another cl, so I'll revert this bit.","draft":false,"lineno":561,"date":"2011-12-10 00:11:14.085622","left":false}],"id":19066,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/mac/audio_output_mac_unittest.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":6,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":7,"num_removed":11,"messages":[],"id":19060,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/audio_input_unittest.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":6,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":24,"num_removed":20,"messages":[],"id":19041,"is_binary":false},"media/audio/win/audio_low_latency_input_win_unittest.cc":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":10,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":34,"num_removed":24,"messages":[{"author":"scherkus","author_email":"scherkus@chromium.org","text":"if (!audio_man)","draft":false,"lineno":92,"date":"2011-12-09 22:47:30.382045","left":false},{"author":"scherkus","author_email":"scherkus@chromium.org","text":".get() etc","draft":false,"lineno":176,"date":"2011-12-09 22:47:30.382301","left":false},{"author":"tommi","author_email":"tommi@chromium.org","text":"On 2011/12/09 22:47:30, scherkus wrote:\n> if (!audio_man)\n\nRemoved check.
